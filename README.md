# ai-search-visualizer
GUI based implementation of BFS, DFS, DLS, IDDFS, Bidirectional and Uniform Cost Search in Python.

The following search algorithms are implemented and visualized:

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
4. Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
5. Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)
6. Bidirectional Search

Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Understand how uninformed search algorithms work
- Compare their behavior visually
- Analyze their performance in best-case and worst-case scenarios
- Study their completeness and optimality properties

---

##  GUI Features

- Grid-based pathfinding environment
- Start and Goal node selection
- Obstacle placement
- Algorithm selection dropdown menu
- Real-time node exploration animation
- Final shortest path highlighting
- Interactive buttons and message popups

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI)
- - ttk (Styled widgets)
- collections (for deque in BFS)
- queue (for PriorityQueue in UCS)
- time (for visualization delay)
